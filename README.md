# Machine Learning Projects Collection

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository.  
This is a curated collection of hands-on machine learning projects I’ve built, designed specifically for **beginners** and **intermediate** learners who want to explore real-world applications of ML.

Each project includes:
- Project description
- Used Dataset
- Step-by-step guide
- Source code
- Demo or output sample
- Pretrained models or datasets (when applicable)

## Who Is This For?

Whether you’re a junior data scientist, a fullstack developer starting in ML, or just curious about how AI works in practice, these projects are made to help you:
- Understand key ML concepts
- Learn by building
- Apply algorithms to real datasets

## Project List (still will share more)

### 1. Spam Email Classifier  
- **Description:** This project demonstrates a high-accuracy spam email classifier using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle. It uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify text messages as spam or ham (not spam).
- **Guide:** [`/spam_email_classifier/README.md`](./spam_email_classifier/README.md)

### 2. Iris Flower Classifier
- **Description:** This project demonstrates a high-accuracy iris flower classifier using the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It applies supervised learning and classification techniques to predict the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on petal and sepal measurements. The model is optimized using GridSearchCV to ensure high performance while avoiding underfitting or overfitting.

### 3. Titanic Survival Predictor
- **Description:** This project builds a high-accuracy logistic regression model to predict the survival of passengers from the Titanic disaster using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It applies supervised learning techniques and focuses on preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure the predictions are both reliable and generalizable. The model is validated using test set performance and 10-fold cross-validation to avoid underfitting or overfitting.
