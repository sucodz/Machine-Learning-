# Machine Learning Projects Collection

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository.  
This is a curated collection of hands-on machine learning projects I’ve built, designed specifically for **beginners** and **intermediate** learners who want to explore real-world applications of ML.

Each project includes:
- Project description
- Used Dataset
- Step-by-step guide
- Source code
- Demo or output sample
- Pretrained models or datasets (when applicable)

## Who Is This For?

Whether you’re a junior data scientist, a fullstack developer starting in ML, or just curious about how AI works in practice, these projects are made to help you:
- Understand key ML concepts
- Learn by building
- Apply algorithms to real datasets

## Project List (still will share more)

### 3. Spam Email Classifier  
**Description:** This project demonstrates a high-accuracy spam email classifier using the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from Kaggle. It uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify text messages as spam or ham (not spam).
